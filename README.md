## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements two intelligent agents for the **AMD AI Premier League (AAIPL)** competition:

### 🧩 Question Agent (Q-Agent)

* Generates logical reasoning questions.
* Covers all required topics:

  * Syllogisms
  * Seating Arrangements
  * Blood Relations & Family Tree
  * Alphanumeric Series
* Produces questions in strict JSON format.
* Ensures clarity, logical validity, and format compliance.

### 🤖 Answer Agent (A-Agent)

* Solves logical reasoning questions generated by opponents.
* Uses a fine-tuned LLM with LoRA adapters for improved reasoning accuracy.
* Returns answers in the required JSON format.
* Designed for speed and robustness under competition constraints.

## 🧠 Model Strategy

### Base Models Used

* **Q-Agent:** Qwen 2.5 (Instruction tuned)
* **A-Agent:** Qwen 2.5 (fine-tuned with LoRA)

### Techniques Used

* LoRA fine-tuning for reasoning accuracy
* Prompt engineering for structured outputs
* JSON validation for strict format compliance
* GPU-optimized inference
